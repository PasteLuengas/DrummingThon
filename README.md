# DrummingThon (Possible Lang Move)
At the moment, Drummingthon is just a simple DrumMachine made in Python (and with a lot... A LOT of bugs), but my idea is make a Drum Machine with saving rythm options, where you can change the rythms (previously made by you) using the keyboard or pedals, so useful where you need a Drummer but you can't find one.

The main reason to change the programming language is the time; Python with PyGame and Flet are not a "fast" group, and sometimes Drummingthon has some errors keeping time... Something extremly important in a Drum Machine.
